My name is Jesse Braham, and I am a software developer currently residing in Vancouver, BC, Canada.

I'm currently employed as a software engineer at [Espressif Systems](https://www.espressif.com/), working on enabling development in the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) on embedded devices. This includes everything from build tools to hardware abstraction layers.

I was previously a systems developer where I worked on supporting software for embedded devices which utilized satellite and cellular communication. Here I mostly used C#.NET, JavaScript, and SQL to build web applications and data processing pipelines.

I am proficient in Rust, Python, JavaScript, C#, Racket, C, and some others. I have experience working with frameworks such as Django, ASP.NET MVC, and Mithril, and have worked with various relational and NoSQL databases.

I have a multitude of interests, which include (but are not limited to) hardware design/embedded development, languages (both programming and human), systems programming (compilers, operating systems, etc.), automation & tooling, engineering & manufacturing, and physical simulations. Outside of tech I love comic books, music, astronomy & physics, and being outdoors.
